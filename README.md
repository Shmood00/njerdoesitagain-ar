# Welcome to Njerdoesitagain's GitHub!

This GitHub page hosts the website you can use to view the AR (augmented reality) features that are attached to each one of Njeri's pieces!

# What is AR?

Augment reality (AR) can enhance user experience by combining reality with the digital world. Microsoft's definition of AR is defined as: 
>...an enhanced, interactive version of a real-world environment achieved through digital visual elements, sound, and other sensory stimuli via holographic technology. 

More information from Microsoft can be found [here](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-ca/mixed-reality/guides/what-is-augmented-reality-ar/).

You've most likely used AR before - remember Pok√©mon GO? Or, have you ever used the "View in your room" feature while browsing Amazon on your phone? Both are examples of AR!

# How Do I Use It?
